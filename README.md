Introduction to this document
This Continuous Assessment Activity takes place in the second part this course; students work on a project during
(academic) weeks 18-19 and submit their individual Project Report at the end of in week 21. This activity and the
corresponding report are worth 30% of the final course mark.
The class is divided into groups, typically comprising three students each. Each group carries out planning, execution
and testing of a given SW project. This document provides the necessary details and accompanies the discussion
during all the course sessions that will take place during weeks 18-19.

Project Specification: Student Record Sort and Search
Each group produce a SW program that operates on a collection of items, progressively refined to represent entries
in a Student Record system. The program takes as input a sorting criterion and produces a sorted version of the
items in the list. The list can then be efficiently searched to find all items that satisfy one or more search criteria.
SW/HW platform: Assume a standard PC as the target for your program. Therefore:
• Produce source code (C/C++) that is generic. Depart from standard libraries only with a justification.
• No specific OS is targeted, Microsoft is the default choice.
• Assume reasonable PC memory resources.
